===========================

Sample Spring Integration application for invoices handling.

Simply run **"mvn clean install"** and then run standard Java main method in class **com.vrtoonjava.invoices.InvoicesApplication**.

If you want to see more detailed output of Spring Integration facilities then modify file **lof4j.xml** and set value of org.springframework.integration from **info** to something finer grained - for example **debug**.
